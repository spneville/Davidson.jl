# [Guess vectors](@id guessvectors)

This section details how the guess vectors are constructed.

## Automated guess vector construction

If either the `solver` function is used, or if the `solver!` function
is used and the keyword argument `guess=false`, then the guess vectors
are constructed automatically. At present, they are simply taken as
the unit vectors corresponding to the `blocksize` lowest-value on-diagonal
matrix elements.

## User-supplied guess vectors
If the `solver!` function is used and the keyword argument `guess=true`,
then the contents of the `vectors` array will be used to construct the guess
vectors. The vectors found are subjected to Lowdin's symmetric orthogonalisation
before being set as the guess vectors.

A total of `blocksize` guess vectors need to be constructed. The number of guess
vectors supplied in the `vectors` array can range from `nroots` to `blocksize`.
If fewer than `blocksize` are found, the rest are generated by adding
normalised random vectors to the set prior to orthogonalisation. On exit,
the first `nroots` vectors in the `vectors` array will be the eigenvectors of
interest.
